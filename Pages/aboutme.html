    <h3>Passionate Learner | Problem Solver | CSE Student | School Topper</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Vedant Tiwari! A dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science student with a deep love for coding and problem-solving. My journey began with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, reflected in my top scores of 97% and 96% in these subjects during my CBSE board exams, was even awarded a scholarship for being the topper of the school.</p>
    <p>My passion for coding led me to create a range of impactful projects. From a quiz engine that addressed the challenges of online schooling during COVID-19, to a comprehensive home automation system that streamlined tasks, my projects span a spectrum of innovation and "practicality".</p>
    <p> Game development is another facet of my creativity. I developed a 3D rocket game using C# and Unity during my 10th standard, and an physics based Android block racing game using the same technologies.</p>
    <p>Currently pursuing a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Business Systems at SRMIST KTR. As part of my continuous learning, I'm also mastering Full Stack Web Development and working towards an Oracle Developer certification.</p>
    <p> With a focus on growth, I'm aspiring to contribute to the tech world through Google Summer of Code (GSoC), combining my coding skills and innovation to impact open-source projects positively.</p>
    <p>Connect with me to discuss coding, tech trends, and collaborative opportunities. Let's shape the future through code together! #CodingPassion #GSoCAspirant</p>
